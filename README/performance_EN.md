# **Performance Measurement Methodology**

## **Introduction**

Measuring the performance of interns is essential for continuous tracking of their development and maximizing the success of assigned tasks. To obtain an accurate and fair view of each intern's performance, a series of key indicators were defined, covering fundamental aspects of the work, such as task completion, time efficiency, communication, and task complexity.

Each indicator is accompanied by a score ranging from 1 to 5, allowing for an objective and clear assessment of the intern's competencies. The calculation of the **Global Performance Score** takes into account the average of the scores assigned to each indicator, resulting in a consolidated view of the intern's performance.

This evaluation method not only measures the internâ€™s effectiveness and efficiency but also provides insights into areas that may require improvements. By using these indicators, it is possible to identify behavior patterns and develop strategies to optimize processes, improve productivity, and strengthen collaboration within the team.

Below, we detail the indicators used to calculate performance and how each one is weighted to form the global evaluation.

### 1. **Percentage of Completed Tasks**
- **Description:** Assesses the ratio between the planned tasks and the tasks actually completed. This indicator is crucial for evaluating the intern's ability to meet established objectives within the set time frame.
- **Score:** The score varies from 1 to 5 based on the completion rate of planned tasks.

### 2. **Additional Time Required**
- **Description:** Examines the additional time required to perform tasks compared to a predefined limit. This indicator directly influences the final score, as excessive time may indicate inefficiency or unexpected difficulties.
- **Score:** The score is determined by the amount of additional time needed to complete the tasks in relation to the pre-set time.

### 3. **Time in Communication**
- **Description:** Measures the average time spent communicating between the intern and other team members. Effective communication is a critical factor for task success and team collaboration.
- **Score:** This indicator is assessed based on the average time spent in communication, with efficient time management leading to a higher score.

### 4. **Task Complexity**
- **Description:** Assesses the complexity of the tasks performed by the interns according to their own perception. More complex tasks require greater effort and skills, which may reflect in the score assigned to performance.
- **Score:** Complexity is rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with more challenging tasks receiving a higher score, considering the context of the intern's performance.

### 5. **Sentiment Towards Performance**
- **Description:** Considers the average sentiment ratings provided by interns regarding their own performance. This indicator is essential for understanding the subjective perception of each intern about their work.
- **Score:** The average sentiment ratings, on a scale of 1 to 5, are used to determine the overall sentiment about the intern's performance.

## Global Performance Score Calculation

Each of the mentioned indicators receives a score from 1 to 5, where 1 represents the lowest value (unsatisfactory performance) and 5 represents the highest value (excellent performance). The **Global Performance Score** is obtained by averaging the individual scores from all the indicators.

### Example Calculation:
- **Completed Tasks:** 4
- **Additional Time Required:** 3
- **Time in Communication:** 5
- **Task Complexity:** 4
- **Sentiment Towards Performance:** 4

**Global Performance Score:**
\[
(4 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4) / 5 = 4
\]

The average of the scores assigned to each indicator results in a final performance evaluation, which will be used in the **Performance and Overall Score** chart in the **Ranking Tab**.
